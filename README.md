# AndroidMalware
The objective of this repository is to detect malware on Android apps.

<i><b>TL;DR:</b> Bad guys abuse permissions and outdated software </i>

# Accessing the Data
The data can be found on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/saurabhshahane/android-malware-dataset

For more background, refer to the [research paper](https://github.com/NadimKawwa/AndroidMalware/blob/main/paper/Menendez%20Benito_ADROIT.%20Android%20malware%20detection%20using%20meta-information_AAM.pdf).

# System Requirements
The entire repository is in Python 3.x and you will need some standard data science libraries like pandas and scikit-learn.

# How to Navigate
The notebooks are ordered sequentially in the order I went about to get this project done. I have added notes in the notebooks to further explain my reasoning.

# Results
I was able to obtain a high enough AUC of 0.94 with logistic regression. The plot below illustrate the ROC and PRC curves as I tried to play with the size of vocabulary.

<b>Spoiler Alert:<b> The determining weights for the model were the numerical features inside the Android Manifest, not the text data.
